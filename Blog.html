                <h1>Q.Difference Between Local Storage, Session Storage.</h1>
                <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. As it is not
                    session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually. The client can only read local storage
                </p>
                <p><strong>Session Storage:</strong> The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB. Itâ€™s session-based
                    and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session,
                    i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed. The client can only read local storage</p>

                <h1>Q.What is difference between global scope and block scope.</h1>
                <p>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's
                    controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for
                    statements, and the like.</p>
                <p><strong>Global Scope:</strong>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are
                    known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be
                    accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Block Scope:</strong>
                    Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                    variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                    statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the
                    curly brackets {}.

                <h1>Q.What is an event loop JavaScript.</h1>
                <p>What is meant by event loop?
                    A programming structure that continually tests for external events and calls the appropriate
                    routines to handle them. An event loop is often the main loop in a program that typically waits for
                    the user to trigger something.What are phases in event loop?
                    The Event Loop contains six main phases: timers, I/O callbacks, preparation / idle phase, I/O
                    polling, setImmediate() callbacks execution, and close events callbacks.

                <h1>Q.How many ways to get undefined in javascript?</h1>
                <p><strong>8 Ways to get Undefined:</strong>
                    <li>A declared variable without assigning any value to it.</li>
                    <li>Implicit returns of functions due to missing return statements.</li>
                    <li>return statements that do not explicitly return anything.</li>
                    <li>Lookups of non-existent properties in an object.</li>
                    <li>Function parameters that have not passed.</li>
                    <li>Anything that has been set to the value of undefined.</li>
                    <li>Any expression in the form of void(expression)</li>
                    <li>The value of the global variable undefined</li>
